Often when considering using a new framework or building a new system we think first and foremost about the simplification it will bring. Everyone secretly dreams of having a perfectly working software that will be easily configurable, easily extendable and will never crash.

It will be so much easier to build new endpoints with Springboot. It will be a breeze to build new metrics with Grafana.

Some time after the new system is introduced we find ourselves supporting more infrastructure, building complicated configuration and opening the whole new dimension of complexity we didn't know existed.

Does the life become easier with introducing new technology? No! The experience in the field tells that the complexity that can be supported by a given team stays about same - hence the conservation of complexity.

The point of this article is to shift the focus: from thinking of burden removed by simplifications to thinking of what kind of complexity will fill the void created by taking another complexity out.
