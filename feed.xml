Aggregation is such an attractiv... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>The conservation of complexity in software development teams</title><link href="https://serdarkurbanov.github.io/posts/conservation-of-complexity/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The conservation of complexity in software development teams" /><published>2022-07-15T18:00:00-04:00</published> <updated>2022-07-15T18:00:00-04:00</updated> <id>https://serdarkurbanov.github.io/posts/conservation-of-complexity/</id> <content src="https://serdarkurbanov.github.io/posts/conservation-of-complexity/" /> <author> <name>Serdar Kurbanov</name> </author> <category term="Blogging" /> <category term="Technical" /> <summary> Systems are never simple Often when considering using a new framework or building a new system we think first and foremost about the simplification it will bring. Everyone secretly dreams of having a perfectly working software that will be easily configurable, easily extendable and will never crash. It will be so much easier to build new endpoints with Springboot. It will be a breeze to build... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>An approach to resolving difficulties</title><link href="https://serdarkurbanov.github.io/posts/overcoming-difficulties/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="An approach to resolving difficulties" /><published>2020-12-26T17:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2020-12-26T17:00:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://serdarkurbanov.github.io/posts/overcoming-difficulties/</id> <content src="https://serdarkurbanov.github.io/posts/overcoming-difficulties/" /> <author> <name>Serdar Kurbanov</name> </author> <category term="Blogging" /> <category term="Non-Technical" /> <summary> I talked to my friend the other day, he currently works in academia. We talked about his satisfaction with the job. He loves it but is overworking so much that I feel that he pays a toll – stressing out, feeling obliged to work on Christmas Eve etc. I mentioned to him that it would be a good idea to reflect on this situation and prepare an exit plan (not necessarily to execute it!). I’d like t... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Documentation As Code With DacDoc</title><link href="https://serdarkurbanov.github.io/posts/dacdoc-intro/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Documentation As Code With DacDoc" /><published>2019-10-01T21:55:00-04:00</published> <updated>2019-10-01T21:55:00-04:00</updated> <id>https://serdarkurbanov.github.io/posts/dacdoc-intro/</id> <content src="https://serdarkurbanov.github.io/posts/dacdoc-intro/" /> <author> <name>Serdar Kurbanov</name> </author> <category term="Blogging" /> <category term="Technical" /> <summary> Technical documentation goes wrong Nearly every project I was working on had problems with a technical documentation (unless a project didn’t have it in the first place).

Making documentation is often a secondary p... </summary> </entry> </feed>
